# MurmurHash and FNV Hash Functions

This repository contains implementations of the MurmurHash and FNV hash functions in Java.

## What are MurmurHash and FNV Hash Functions?

MurmurHash and FNV (Fowler-Noll-Vo) are two popular non-cryptographic hash functions used for hash table lookups, checksums, and other applications where a fast and simple hash function is needed.

MurmurHash is a family of hash functions developed by Austin Appleby in 2008. It is known for its high performance and low collision rates, making it a popular choice for hash table implementations.

FNV is a hash function created by Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll, and Kiem-Phong Vo in 1991. It is a simple and fast hash function that is often used in checksums and other applications where a non-cryptographic hash function is sufficient.
